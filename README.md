# How To Coding

Come with me and learn some Python!

I made this for my nephews who wanted to build a video game. This will take some time and a lot of lessons / smaller steps along the way.

Have someone help you clone this repository to get started and follow along for the lessons in order to create several types of games as an interactive way of learning Python. Or honestly just browse the lessons folders here in order and follow along that way.

# Prerequisites

You should already have Python installed on your computer and be able to open up a command line prompt or at least have a code editor that will allow you to run python programs.

Go to python.org to see how to install python

For a code editor I use Visual Studio Code, but for beginners something like Thonny might work well. There are a bunch out there so find one that meets your needs!
