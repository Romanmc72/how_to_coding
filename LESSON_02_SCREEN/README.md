# Screen

This game will cover the coordinate plane and will let us actually create a character on the screen which we can control using the keyboard. We will make it so this character is responsive to our commands, and maybe put some cookies on the screen for our character to eat. We will see if we get that ambitious...

## Using this lesson

Same as before, check out the folders here in order to pick up some new programming concepts and by the end of this we will be making our own game together. Let's go!

## Prerequisites

Are you running windows? Oh no, please say no... Well if you are. This whole lesson will not work.

If your first reaction is to blame me for this, I would tell you to instead think of blaming Bill Gates. Whether or not you believe stuff about him putting 5G in the vaccines, you do need to know that he very intentionally went about creating his own operating system called "windows". While windows may dominate a lot of the market share for basic business laptop operating systems, it is not in fact designed for the developer. Unless of course you are a developer for only windows.

To be fair, Steve Jobs (may god rest his soul) did something similar when it comes to the developer ecosystem for apple-products. (want to develop iPhone or Mac apps? Well, you need a Mac). But at least the most common server-side technology called linux is fairly interoperable with Mac. With windows though? no. Just no. 

So my recommendation? Get a mac! Get a linux machine even, idc what just don't make me adapt these tutorials to work on both Mac and Windows. I just don't have a windows machine or a desire to get one. That or find yourself some other curriculum.
