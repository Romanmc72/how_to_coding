# Print

Welcome to coding, as is the tradition of our people, you will start with the earliest known program for every known programming language.

"Hello World"

## Hello World

This is essentially geared to ensure that python *works* on your computer, as well as to give one small lesson that will yield a quick **success**!

### Step 1

Create a file called `main.py`.

The name of the file does not matter at all, but calling it `main` let's us know that it is the *main* program we intend to run, and the `.py` tells your computer that it is a python file.

### Step 2

Inside that `main.py` file, add the following:

```python3
print("Hello World!")
```

then save the file.

### Step 3

Run your program!

How?

In your terminal, position your current directory to the same place as this `main.py` file, then run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

and you *should* see this:

```python3
Hello World!
```

### Done

Nice! You did it, Python works.

## Why is it called print

As far as I know, since the oldest computers used to actually work on paper with punch holes, those computers would always physically print things. Now that we have screens, we're not "printing" per se in the sense that we are not using a printer, but we are doing what the old school computers used to do which is share the output of the program to the person running the program. Just instead of "print"ing on paper, we "print" on screen.
