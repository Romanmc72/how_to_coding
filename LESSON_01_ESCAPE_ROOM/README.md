# Escape Room

We will go through a few lessons here to create an escape room style game! Beware that this game will not have any fancy graphics. None. It will be all text based. It will be fun I hope. First we mus learn a few things.

## Using this Curriculum

We will proceed through these lessons in numerical order to create small programs that build off of one another, each covering a new idea.

Follow the directions and have some fun! Feel free to make it your own by changing up the words/prompts.

The last lesson will be actually building an interactive game which we can use to simulate a virtual escape room.

Hop in, have fun, and google things/ask questions if you get stuck!
